# Titanic Disaster Data Analysis

This project explores the key factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster using the Titanic dataset. The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and visually summarized in a poster presentation.

## 📌 Objective

To investigate the hypothesis:

> The key factors deciding the survival of the Titanic disaster were **Sex**, **Age**, **Passenger Class**, and **Travelling Alone or With Family**.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Sex**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males, suggesting gender bias in rescue efforts.
- **Age**: Younger passengers, particularly children, had higher survival rates. Most non-survivors were between 20–40 years old.
- **Passenger Class**: 1st-class passengers had the highest survival rates, while 3rd-class passengers had the lowest, indicating the impact of socioeconomic status.
- **Traveling Alone vs With Family**: Passengers with family had slightly better survival chances, possibly due to mutual aid or prioritization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
